# Vector-Declaration-Exercise
A look into how to declare vectors in c++

## Description(Detailed)
  Greetings! you may be wondering why I made this. To put it simply, I made this very basic vector code because I had spent all my time searching up how to make vectors in c++ BUT never actually had hands on experience...Until now. this is just a primer for me, look at this in terms of me showing that I can write a vector  declaration in c++. I plan to post more content like this up on my github so people can see what I am up to. Upon getting more experience I will post more content that is focuesd on Unity c# and Unreal engine 4 C++. Until then this is what I have to show to demonstrate my understanding/experience with c++.
